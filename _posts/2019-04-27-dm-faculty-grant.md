I was awarded a [Digital Matters Faculty Grant](https://digitalmatters.utah.edu/faculty-grant-awardees-fall19/) to support transcription work for a collection of mining records from 1900-1919. I'm hoping that this will help us provide more information about these records, which are already digitized. Being able to have some dedicated funds for transcription will also help us release the data associated with the collection, and I hope it will be of interest to people who are studying the history of labor in the Mountain West as well as providing a regional database that can be used at the University of Utah for visualizations and other Collections as Data explorations. Work on this will start in the fall semester, 2019.
