Here's an article that was just published in the Journal of Library Metadata, [Western Name Authority File: A Pilot Regional Name Authority Project](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19386389.2019.1589685?journalCode=wjlm20). This provides an overview of the IMLS-funded [Western Name Authority project](https://sites.google.com/site/westernnameauthorityfile/) that Jeremy Myntti and I have been working on for the past two years. The article is appearing in a forthcoming special issue on authority control, and it is wonderful to be included and see the other articles on authority control in digital libraries being published by colleagues.
