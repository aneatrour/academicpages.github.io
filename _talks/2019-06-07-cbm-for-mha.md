Often when people are working on digital projects for the first time the idea of “putting it online” comes as a bit of an afterthought, without a real understanding of the labor and time involved in developing a web site. 
So I’m going to be a bit technical in discussing what went in to developing the Century of Black Mormons site, with the hope that this will be useful for anyone developing a similar public history project.  

To be more specific, I’m going to focus on the digital part of digital public history.  

Collaboration with the library provided answers to these 4 questions, which I think anyone contemplating a digital public history project should consider. 
Getting information ready for the web, putting a project team together, and developing metadata, workflows and a project plan is what is in my wheelhouse as a digital initiatives librarian.

We are fortunate to have people at my library who can provide the IT support needed to set up a website, install software on a server, and develop a customized theme for Century of Black Mormons.

The answer to each of these questions in an organization like a large university library means drawing on the expertise of multiple team members. If you are doing your public history project solo, or at a institution with fewer resources, it might mean learning and taking on these roles yourself, outsourcing something like web hosting to a commercial vendor, or seeing some of these roles get collapsed.
