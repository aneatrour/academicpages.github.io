In 2016, the University of Utah's J. Willard Marriott Library migrated digital asset management systems from CONTENTdm, a vendor-provided solution from OCLC, to Solphal, a homegrown system utilizing several open source tools. During the migration, issues with metadata led to a large-scale metadata cleanup and standardization project, enhancing discovery in the new system. This article discusses the method used to determine which system would best meet the library's needs, methods for metadata migration, issues observed during migration, metadata management capabilities of the new system, and future plans for post-migration metadata cleanup and remediation to ensure that the metadata is consistent with best practices.
