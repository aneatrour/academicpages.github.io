The use of controlled vocabularies is essential in the creation of metadata for digital collections in order to provide consistency and ease of use for patrons and researchers. The University of Utah has been working to clean up metadata for digital collections to ensure that data adheres to best practices with the use of specific, controlled vocabularies. This has included a major data-cleanup project utilizing multiple approaches including a vendor's authority control service, data reconciliation in OpenRefine, and the exploration of different tools used for the creation and maintenance of local controlled vocabularies.
