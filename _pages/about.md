I'm Anna Neatrour, digital initiatives librarian at the University of Utah. I manage descriptive metadata workflows, the digital exhibits program, and support emerging technology projects at my library. I was previously a metadata librarian at the Mountain West Digital Library, the executive director of the Utah Library Association, and I began my career in libraries as an instruction librarian. My research interests include name authority control in digital libraries, collaborative digitization, the intersection of digital humanities and digital libraries, and metadata community support.
